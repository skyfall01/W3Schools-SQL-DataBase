# W3Schools-SQL-DataBase
Not associated with W3Schools.\
Visit their [website](https://www.w3schools.com) for tutorials on WebProgramming.\
All the Tables in W3Schools Database which were used in SQL tutorials can be found on the right hand side if you run this [example](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all).\
I couldn't find location/link on w3schools website to download the database, so I created it.\
Note: All the Field names, Table names were renamed with lower case letters for ease of use. 
# How to use
Directly download w3schools.db.\
Download [SQLite Pre-Compiled Binaries](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) for your respective platform.\
Make sure SQLite is set to system path.\
In the folder where you have downloaded the database file, open CMD/ Terminal and type,
```
sqlite3 w3schools.db
```
Now you can start using SQL Queries
